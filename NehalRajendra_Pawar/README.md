"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Describe how the observer pattern has been implemented:
The original node acts a subject and the backup 1 and 2 act as listner. 
The Node call implements both subject and listner. The notifyAll method 
updates both the backup listners whose reference is stored in original
node.
